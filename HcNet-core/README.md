HcNet-core is a replicated state machine that maintains a local copy of a cryptographic ledger and processes transactions against it, in consensus with a set of peers.
It implements the [HcNet Consensus Protocol](https://github.com/HcNet/HcNet-core/blob/master/src/scp/readme.md), a _federated_ consensus protocol.
It is written in C++14 and runs on Linux, OSX and Windows.
